## Dreaming381

Hello! My name is Tyler (one of many), and I am an electrical engineering student at South Dakota State as well as a hobbyist game developer / CGI artist. Right now this place is pretty bare bones, as I mainly set this up for an online WebGL course through Dakota State.

### Development Experience and Interests

Unity is my game engine of choice. However, I have worked on some homebrew projects in C++ in the past. I mostly focus on 3D games. I have a little experience with writing shaders in Unity and will hopefully continue to expand my skillset.
